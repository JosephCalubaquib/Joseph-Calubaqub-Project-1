<h1>My School</h1>

<p>This school is located in West Haven, CT. The School is very expensive, but luckily they provide scholarships to students. The food on campus is not very good and the school has yet to fix the issue. Like all schools, there are some good professors and some bad professors. Overall this school is okay and a good place to learn.</p>
